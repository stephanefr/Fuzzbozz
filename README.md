# Fuzzbozz
This project is given to Epitech student as an C exercise.

The only trick is that you cannot use fprintf().

## Problem statement

Write a program that takes two numbers as parameters and
prints all the integers between these two numbers according to the
following rules:

For this project, the only authorized functions are `write`, `atoi`, `printf`.

the second parameter must be greater than or equal as the first one,

if the number is a multiple of 3, print "Fuzz\n",

if the number is a multiple of 2, print "Bozz\n",

if the number is a multiple of both 2 and 3, print "FuzzBozz\n",

in all other case, print the number followed by '\n'.
